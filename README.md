# renesas-bootmode
serial interface library for renesas microcontrollers in boot mode

## hardware
This library is tested using a FTDI FT232RL USB to serial adapter

(make sure you use one that can match Vcc of the microcontroller - 5V or 3.3V)

### notes
* assumes MCU already has pull-up resistors on RX/TX lines
* assumes MCU already has pull-down resistor on RESET lines
* momentarily set reset low then hold high to get into boot mode

### notes
* assumes MCU already has pull-up resistor on TX/RX line
* assumes MCU already has pull-down resistor on RESET lines
* tri-state buffer (`|>`) setup
  * enable line wired to inverted FTDI TX
  * input line wired to GND
  * output line wired to TX/RX
